# Brain Tumor Detection

Welcome to the Brain Tumor Detection project, a deep learning model designed to detect brain tumors using neural networks. This model has been trained on a dataset, achieving 98% accuracy on the training set and 100% accuracy on the test set.

## Overview

This project focuses on leveraging deep learning techniques for the early detection of brain tumors in medical images. The trained model is capable of analyzing MRI scans and providing accurate predictions regarding the presence of tumors.

## Model Performance

- Training Accuracy: 98%
- Test Accuracy: 100%
